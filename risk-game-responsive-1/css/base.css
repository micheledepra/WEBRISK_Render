Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version:** Develop a separate build for mobile platforms (iOS and Android) that can share some core assets and logic but is optimized for touch controls and smaller screens.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout Adjustments:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size. This includes:
     - **Dynamic Aspect Ratios:** Use flexible layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
     - **Adjustable Sidebars:** Modify the dimensions and positioning of sidebars and other UI elements based on the device's resolution and aspect ratio.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (keyboard/mouse for PC, touch controls for mobile).
   - **Shared Game Logic:** If possible, share game logic and assets between the PC and mobile versions to reduce development time and maintain consistency.

### 4. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **Consistent Gameplay:** Ensure that the gameplay experience is consistent across platforms, even if the controls and UI differ.
   - **Testing Across Devices:** Conduct thorough testing on various devices to ensure that the game performs well and is user-friendly on both PC and mobile.

### 5. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **User Interface Differences:** Users may find it confusing if the UI is significantly different between platforms. Aim for a similar look and feel while adapting to the respective platform's strengths.
   - **Gameplay Mechanics:** If gameplay mechanics differ between platforms (e.g., touch vs. mouse controls), provide clear tutorials or guides to help users adapt.
   - **Version Control:** Keep track of updates and changes for both versions to avoid confusion about which features are available on which platform.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to maintain the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are essential to minimize confusion. Focus on creating a seamless experience across platforms while respecting the unique characteristics of each device. Regular user feedback can also help identify and address any confusion that arises.
