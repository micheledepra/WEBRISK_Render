Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. This approach can be implemented with careful planning and design considerations. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **Separate Builds**:
   - **Maintain the PC Version**: Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version**: Develop a separate build for mobile devices that can share some assets and code but is optimized for touch controls and smaller screens.

### 2. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size. Use flexible layouts that can adapt to different aspect ratios.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling**: Ensure that the sidebar and other UI components resize and reposition themselves based on the device's resolution and orientation.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - **Input Handling**: Implement touch controls for mobile while keeping keyboard and mouse controls for PC. Consider using a gamepad for both platforms if applicable.
   - **Data Synchronization**: If the game has online features, ensure that player data is synchronized across platforms, allowing users to play on both PC and mobile seamlessly.

### 4. **User Experience**:
   - **Consistent Experience**: Aim for a consistent experience across platforms, but be aware that the gameplay may need to be adjusted for mobile (e.g., shorter sessions, simplified controls).
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding**: Provide clear tutorials for mobile users to help them understand the controls and gameplay mechanics, which may differ from the PC version.

### 5. **Testing and Feedback**:
   - **Extensive Testing**: Conduct thorough testing on various devices to ensure that the game performs well and the UI is user-friendly.
   - **Gather Feedback**: Collect feedback from users on both platforms to identify any confusion or usability issues.

### Potential Confusion:
- **Learning Curve**: Players transitioning from PC to mobile may experience a learning curve due to different controls and UI layouts.
- **Feature Discrepancies**: If certain features are available on one platform but not the other, it could lead to confusion among players.
- **Performance Variability**: Differences in performance and graphics quality between platforms may affect user experience.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility while keeping the PC version unchanged, careful attention must be paid to design, user experience, and testing to minimize confusion. By focusing on responsive design and consistent gameplay mechanics, you can create a seamless experience for players across different devices.
