Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: Maintain two separate versions of the game (one for PC and one for mobile). This allows you to optimize each version for its platform but can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Use a single codebase that can adapt to different platforms. This is generally more efficient and easier to maintain.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size. Use relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed units (like pixels) for layout dimensions.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling**: Create a UI that can scale and rearrange itself based on the device's aspect ratio. This may involve using layout managers or frameworks that support responsive design.

### 3. **Input Handling**
   - **Touch vs. Mouse**: Implement different input handling for touch screens (mobile) and mouse/keyboard (PC). This may involve creating separate input systems or adapting the existing one to recognize the type of input device.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Resource Management**: Ensure that the game runs smoothly on both platforms by optimizing graphics and performance. Mobile devices typically have less processing power than PCs, so you may need to adjust graphics settings or reduce asset sizes for mobile.

### 5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - **Networking**: If your game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play. This may involve using a common server architecture that can handle connections from both PC and mobile clients.
   - **Account Management**: Consider how players will manage their accounts across platforms. You might need a unified account system that allows players to log in from any device.

### 6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - **Extensive Testing**: Test the game on various devices and screen sizes to ensure that the UI and gameplay experience are consistent and enjoyable across platforms.
   - **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from users on both platforms to identify any confusion or usability issues.

### 7. **Documentation and Tutorials**
   - **In-Game Tutorials**: Provide tutorials or tooltips that help players understand the controls and UI on their specific platform.
   - **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for players regarding any differences in gameplay or controls between PC and mobile versions.

### Potential Confusion
- **User Experience**: If not implemented carefully, players may find the experience confusing, especially if the UI behaves differently on different platforms. Consistency in design and functionality is key.
- **Control Schemes**: Players may struggle with different control schemes (touch vs. mouse/keyboard), so clear communication about controls is essential.
- **Performance Expectations**: Players may have different expectations regarding performance and graphics quality based on their platform, which could lead to dissatisfaction if not managed well.

### Conclusion
While it is entirely feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are crucial to avoid confusion and ensure a seamless experience across platforms. By focusing on responsive design, input handling, and thorough testing, you can create a game that is enjoyable for players on both PC and mobile devices.
