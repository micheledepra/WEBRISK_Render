Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version:** Develop a separate build for mobile devices that can be optimized for touch controls and smaller screens.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout Adjustments:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the aspect ratio and layout based on the screen size. This can involve:
     - Using flexible UI elements that resize or reposition based on the screen dimensions.
     - Adjusting the size and position of sidebars, buttons, and other UI components to ensure they are usable on smaller screens.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Shared Codebase:** If possible, use a shared codebase for both versions to minimize duplication of effort. This can be achieved using game engines that support cross-platform development (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine).
   - **Input Handling:** Implement different input methods for PC (keyboard/mouse) and mobile (touch controls). Ensure that the game logic can handle both input types seamlessly.

### 4. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **UI/UX Design:** Design the user interface to be intuitive on both platforms. Mobile users may require larger buttons and simplified navigation.
   - **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing on both platforms to ensure that the gameplay experience is consistent and enjoyable.

### 5. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **User Expectations:** Players may have different expectations based on the platform they are using. Ensure that the core gameplay experience remains consistent across platforms to avoid confusion.
   - **Feature Parity:** Decide whether to include all features from the PC version in the mobile version. If some features are omitted or altered, communicate these changes clearly to users.
   - **Performance Differences:** Be aware that performance may vary between platforms, which could lead to confusion if not managed properly.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are essential to minimize confusion. By focusing on responsive design, user experience, and clear communication, you can create a cohesive experience across platforms.
