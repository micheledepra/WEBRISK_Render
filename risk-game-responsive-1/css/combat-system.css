Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds**:
   - **Maintain Separate Codebases**: You can maintain a separate codebase for the PC version and the mobile version. This allows you to keep the PC version unchanged while developing the mobile version.
   - **Shared Assets**: Use shared assets (like graphics and sounds) to minimize duplication and ensure consistency across platforms.

### 2. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the aspect ratio and layout based on the screen size. This can involve using flexible UI elements that scale or reposition based on the device's resolution.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling**: Use techniques like anchoring and scaling to ensure that UI elements (like sidebars) adjust according to the screen size. This may involve using percentage-based dimensions or layout managers that adapt to different resolutions.

### 3. **Input Handling**:
   - **Touch vs. Mouse Input**: Implement different input handling for mobile (touch controls) and PC (mouse/keyboard). This may require creating a separate input system or adapting the existing one to handle both types of input seamlessly.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - **Networking**: If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play. This may involve using a common server architecture that can handle connections from both PC and mobile clients.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Mobile devices typically have less processing power than PCs, so optimize the game for performance on mobile without compromising the PC experience.

### 5. **Testing**:
   - **Extensive Testing**: Test the game on various devices and screen sizes to ensure that the UI and gameplay experience are consistent and enjoyable across platforms.
   - **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from users on both platforms to identify any confusion or usability issues.

### 6. **Potential Confusion**:
   - **User Experience**: If the game mechanics or UI differ significantly between platforms, it could lead to confusion for players who switch between devices. Aim for a consistent experience where possible.
   - **Documentation and Tutorials**: Provide clear documentation and tutorials for both platforms to help users understand any differences in controls or gameplay.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are essential to minimize confusion and ensure a smooth user experience. By focusing on responsive design, input handling, and thorough testing, you can create a cohesive cross-platform experience.
