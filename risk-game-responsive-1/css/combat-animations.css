Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: Maintain two separate versions of the game (one for PC and one for mobile). This allows you to optimize each version for its respective platform but can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Use a single codebase that can adapt to different platforms. This is often more efficient and can be achieved using game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine, which support cross-platform development.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Resolution**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the game's UI and gameplay elements based on the screen size and aspect ratio. This can involve using relative positioning and scaling for UI elements.
   - **Dynamic Layouts**: Use layout managers or similar tools to rearrange UI components based on the device's screen size. For example, a sidebar might be displayed differently on a mobile device compared to a PC.

### 3. **Input Method Adaptation**
   - **Control Schemes**: Adapt the control scheme for mobile devices (touch controls) while keeping the PC controls unchanged (keyboard/mouse). This may involve creating a virtual joystick or buttons for mobile users.
   - **Input Handling**: Ensure that the game can handle different input methods seamlessly, allowing players to switch between devices if needed.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Resource Management**: Optimize graphics and performance for mobile devices, which may have less processing power compared to PCs. This might involve reducing texture sizes, simplifying models, or adjusting graphical settings.
   - **Testing Across Devices**: Regularly test the game on various devices to ensure performance and usability are consistent.

### 5. **User Experience Considerations**
   - **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent user experience across platforms, but be mindful of the differences in interaction paradigms (e.g., touch vs. mouse).
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding**: Provide tutorials or onboarding experiences tailored to each platform to help users understand the controls and gameplay mechanics.

### 6. **Potential Confusion**
   - **User Interface Complexity**: If not designed carefully, the UI could become cluttered or confusing, especially if the game tries to accommodate too many screen sizes and input methods simultaneously.
   - **Gameplay Balance**: Ensure that gameplay remains balanced across platforms. For example, if mobile players have touch controls, they should not be at a disadvantage compared to PC players with precise mouse controls.

### Conclusion
While it is entirely feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add cross-platform compatibility, careful planning and execution are crucial to avoid confusion and ensure a smooth user experience. By focusing on responsive design, input adaptation, and performance optimization, you can create a game that works well on both PC and mobile devices without compromising the experience on either platform.
