Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: You can maintain a separate version for PC and mobile. This allows you to optimize each version for its platform but can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Using a single codebase that adapts to different platforms can simplify updates and maintenance. Frameworks like Unity or Unreal Engine support cross-platform development.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size. Use relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed units (like pixels) for positioning and sizing.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling**: Create a layout that can rearrange or resize elements based on the device's screen dimensions. This may involve using layout managers or responsive design techniques.

### 3. **Input Handling**
   - **Touch vs. Mouse**: Ensure that the game can handle both touch inputs (for mobile) and mouse/keyboard inputs (for PC). This may require different control schemes or input mappings.
   - **UI Adjustments**: Make sure that buttons and interactive elements are appropriately sized for touch screens.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Mobile devices typically have less processing power than PCs. Optimize graphics, reduce asset sizes, and manage memory usage to ensure smooth performance on mobile.

### 5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Use a framework or engine that supports cross-platform development. This will help you manage differences in performance and input methods more easily.
   - Implement cloud saves or account systems to allow players to continue their progress across devices.

### 6. **Testing**
   - Thoroughly test the game on various devices and screen sizes to ensure that the experience is consistent and enjoyable across platforms.

### 7. **User Experience**
   - Consider how the game experience might differ between platforms. Some features may need to be adjusted or removed for mobile to maintain usability.

### Confusion and Complexity
- **User Confusion**: If not implemented carefully, players might find it confusing if the game behaves differently on different platforms. Clear communication about controls, features, and any limitations is essential.
- **Development Complexity**: Maintaining a cross-platform game can increase complexity, especially if you need to handle different performance characteristics, input methods, and screen sizes. However, using modern game engines can mitigate some of this complexity.

### Conclusion
While adding cross-platform compatibility and adjusting for different screen sizes can introduce some complexity, it is certainly achievable with careful planning and execution. The key is to ensure a consistent user experience across platforms while optimizing for the strengths and limitations of each device type.
