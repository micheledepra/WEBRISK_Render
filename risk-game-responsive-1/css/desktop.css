Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: You can maintain a separate version of the game for PC and mobile. This allows you to optimize each version for its platform but can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Using a single codebase that adapts to different platforms can simplify updates and maintenance. Frameworks like Unity or Unreal Engine support cross-platform development.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size and aspect ratio. This can involve using flexible layouts, anchors, and scaling techniques.
   - **Dynamic UI**: Create a UI that can rearrange or resize elements based on the device. For example, sidebars can be hidden or collapsed on smaller screens.

### 3. **Input Method Adaptation**
   - Ensure that the game controls are adaptable for touch input on mobile devices while retaining keyboard and mouse controls for PC. This may involve creating different control schemes or allowing players to customize their controls.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Mobile devices typically have less processing power than PCs. Optimize graphics, reduce asset sizes, and consider using lower-resolution textures for mobile versions to ensure smooth performance.

### 5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Implement a system for cross-platform play, ensuring that players on different devices can interact with each other. This may involve server-side adjustments to handle different input methods and performance levels.

### 6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Extensive testing is crucial to ensure that the game performs well across different devices and screen sizes. This includes testing for UI scaling, performance, and gameplay experience.

### 7. **User Experience Considerations**
   - Consider how the user experience may differ between platforms. Mobile users may have different expectations regarding gameplay length, control schemes, and accessibility.

### Confusion and Complexity
- **User Confusion**: If not implemented carefully, players may find it confusing if the game experience differs significantly between platforms. Clear communication about controls, features, and gameplay differences is essential.
- **Development Complexity**: Maintaining a cross-platform game can increase complexity in development, especially if you need to handle different performance characteristics and input methods. However, using modern game engines can help mitigate this complexity.

### Conclusion
While adding cross-platform compatibility and adjusting the UI for different screen sizes can be complex, it is achievable with careful planning and execution. The key is to ensure a consistent and enjoyable experience across all platforms while maintaining the integrity of the original PC version.
