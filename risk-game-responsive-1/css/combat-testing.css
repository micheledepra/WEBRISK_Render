Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds**:
   - **Maintain Separate Codebases**: You can maintain a separate codebase for mobile while keeping the PC version intact. This allows you to make changes specific to mobile without affecting the PC version.
   - **Shared Assets**: Use shared assets where possible to minimize duplication, but keep platform-specific logic separate.

### 2. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the aspect ratio and layout based on the screen size. This can involve using flexible UI elements that scale or reposition based on the device's resolution.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling**: Use a layout system that can adapt to different screen sizes, such as anchoring UI elements to corners or edges of the screen, and using relative positioning.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - **Input Handling**: Ensure that input methods are compatible across platforms. For example, touch controls for mobile and keyboard/mouse for PC.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Optimize performance for mobile devices, which may have less processing power compared to PCs.

### 4. **Testing**:
   - **Extensive Testing**: Test the game on various devices to ensure that the user experience is consistent and that the UI adapts correctly to different screen sizes and resolutions.
   - **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from users on both platforms to identify any usability issues.

### 5. **Potential Confusion**:
   - **User Experience**: If the game mechanics or UI differ significantly between platforms, it could lead to confusion for players who switch between devices. Aim for a consistent experience across platforms.
   - **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation or tutorials for players to understand any differences in controls or gameplay mechanics.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility and adjust the UI for different screen sizes without changing the PC version, careful planning and execution are essential. The complexity of managing separate builds and ensuring a consistent user experience can be challenging, but with proper design and testing, it can be done effectively.
