Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds**:
   - **Maintain Separate Codebases**: You can maintain a separate codebase for mobile while keeping the PC version intact. This allows you to make changes specific to mobile without affecting the PC version.
   - **Shared Assets**: Use shared assets where possible to minimize duplication of resources.

### 2. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Aspect Ratio and Resolution**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the aspect ratio and dimensions of UI elements (like sidebars) based on the screen size. This can be done using relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed pixel values.
   - **Flexible Layouts**: Use layout systems that adapt to different screen sizes, such as grid or flexbox layouts in web technologies, or similar systems in game engines.

### 3. **Input Handling**:
   - **Touch vs. Mouse Input**: Implement different input handling for touch screens (mobile) and mouse/keyboard (PC). This may involve creating touch-friendly controls and ensuring that the game is playable without a mouse.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - **Networking**: If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play. This may involve using a common server architecture that can handle connections from both PC and mobile clients.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Mobile devices typically have less processing power than PCs, so optimize performance for mobile without compromising the PC experience.

### 5. **User Interface (UI) Adjustments**:
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling**: Create a UI that scales dynamically based on the device's screen size. This includes adjusting button sizes, text readability, and layout.
   - **Testing on Multiple Devices**: Test the game on various devices to ensure that the UI and gameplay experience are consistent and user-friendly across platforms.

### 6. **Potential Confusion**:
   - **User Experience**: If not managed well, having different versions can lead to confusion among players regarding features, controls, and gameplay mechanics. Clear communication about differences and updates is essential.
   - **Version Control**: Keeping track of changes and ensuring that both versions remain compatible can be challenging. Use version control systems to manage updates effectively.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility and adjust the UI for different screen sizes, it requires careful planning and implementation. The complexity can increase, but with a structured approach, you can minimize confusion and create a seamless experience for players across platforms. Regular testing and feedback from users will also help in refining the experience.
