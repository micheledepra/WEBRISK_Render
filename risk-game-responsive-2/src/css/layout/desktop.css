Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: You can maintain a separate version for PC and mobile. This allows you to optimize each version for its platform but can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Using a single codebase that adapts to different platforms can simplify updates and maintenance. Frameworks like Unity or Unreal Engine support cross-platform development.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size. Use relative positioning and scaling to ensure that the game looks good on both PC and mobile screens.
   - **Dynamic UI**: Create a UI that can rearrange itself based on the available screen space. For example, sidebars can be hidden or collapsed on smaller screens.

### 3. **Input Handling**
   - **Touch vs. Mouse**: Implement different input handling for touch screens and mouse/keyboard. Ensure that controls are intuitive for both types of input.
   - **Customizable Controls**: Allow players to customize controls on mobile devices to enhance usability.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Resource Management**: Optimize graphics and performance for mobile devices, which may have less processing power compared to PCs.
   - **Testing**: Regularly test on various devices to ensure performance and usability.

### 5. **User Experience (UX)**
   - **Consistent Experience**: Aim for a consistent user experience across platforms, but be mindful of the differences in interaction methods and screen sizes.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding**: Provide tutorials or onboarding experiences that cater to both PC and mobile users, as they may have different expectations.

### 6. **Version Control**
   - **Versioning**: Keep track of versions for both platforms. You can use semantic versioning to manage updates and ensure that players know which version they are using.

### 7. **Confusion Management**
   - **Clear Communication**: Clearly communicate any differences between the PC and mobile versions to users. This can be done through in-game messages, documentation, or marketing materials.
   - **Consistent Branding**: Maintain consistent branding and visual elements across platforms to reduce confusion.

### Conclusion
While adding cross-platform compatibility can introduce complexity, careful planning and implementation can minimize confusion. By focusing on responsive design, input handling, and user experience, you can create a cohesive experience for players on both PC and mobile devices. Regular testing and feedback from users will also help you identify and address any potential issues.
