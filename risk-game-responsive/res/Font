Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: You can maintain a separate version for PC and mobile, which allows you to optimize each version for its respective platform. However, this can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Using a single codebase that adapts to different platforms can reduce maintenance efforts. Frameworks like Unity or Unreal Engine support cross-platform development and can help manage different screen sizes and aspect ratios.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size and aspect ratio. This can involve using flexible layouts, anchors, and scaling techniques to ensure that the game looks good on both PC and mobile screens.
   - **Dynamic UI**: Create a dynamic UI that rearranges or resizes elements based on the device. For example, sidebars can be hidden or collapsed on smaller screens.

### 3. **Input Handling**
   - **Touch vs. Mouse**: Ensure that the game can handle different input methods. Touch controls for mobile devices may require a different approach than mouse and keyboard controls for PC.
   - **Customizable Controls**: Allow players to customize their controls, which can help accommodate different devices.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Resource Management**: Optimize graphics and performance for mobile devices, which may have less processing power compared to PCs. This may involve reducing texture sizes, simplifying models, or adjusting graphical settings.

### 5. **Testing Across Devices**
   - **Extensive Testing**: Test the game on various devices to ensure that it performs well and that the UI is user-friendly across different screen sizes and resolutions.

### 6. **User Experience**
   - **Consistent Experience**: Aim for a consistent user experience across platforms. While the controls and UI may differ, the core gameplay should remain the same.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding**: Provide tutorials or onboarding experiences that cater to both PC and mobile users, helping them understand the controls and gameplay mechanics.

### Confusion and Complexity
- **Potential Confusion**: Maintaining a separate version for PC while adding mobile compatibility can lead to confusion if not managed properly. Players may have different expectations based on their platform, and inconsistencies in gameplay or UI can lead to frustration.
- **Complexity in Development**: The complexity of development increases with cross-platform compatibility, especially in terms of testing and ensuring that features work seamlessly across devices.

### Conclusion
While it is feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are essential to minimize confusion and complexity. By focusing on responsive design, input handling, and performance optimization, you can create a cohesive experience for players on both platforms.
