### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Build:** Develop a separate version of the game optimized for mobile devices. This may involve adjusting controls, UI, and performance optimizations.

### 2. **Aspect Ratio and UI Adjustments:**
   - **Responsive Design:** Implement a responsive UI that adjusts based on the screen size and aspect ratio. Use flexible layouts that can adapt to different resolutions.
   - **Dynamic Sidebars:** Adjust the dimensions of sidebars and other UI elements based on the device's screen size. This can be done using relative positioning and scaling.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (touch for mobile, keyboard/mouse for PC).
   - **Networking:** If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play.

### 4. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **Consistent Experience:** Aim for a consistent experience across platforms, but be aware that some features may need to be modified or omitted on mobile due to hardware limitations.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding:** Provide tutorials or onboarding experiences tailored to each platform to help users understand the controls and interface.

### 5. **Testing and Feedback:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Conduct thorough testing on both platforms to identify any issues with gameplay, performance, or user interface.
   - **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from users on both platforms to make necessary adjustments and improvements.

### 6. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **Learning Curve:** Players who switch between platforms may experience a learning curve due to different controls and UI layouts.
   - **Feature Discrepancies:** If certain features are available on one platform but not the other, it could lead to confusion. Clear communication about what is available on each platform is essential.
   - **Performance Variability:** Players may notice differences in performance or graphics quality between platforms, which could affect their experience.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to maintain the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are crucial to minimize confusion. By focusing on responsive design, consistent user experience, and thorough testing, you can create a cross-platform game that appeals to a wider audience without alienating existing PC players.
