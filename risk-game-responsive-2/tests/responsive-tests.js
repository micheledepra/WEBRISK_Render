Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact, ensuring that any changes made for mobile do not affect it.
   - **Create a Mobile Build:** Develop a separate build for mobile platforms (iOS and Android) that includes the necessary adjustments for touch controls and screen sizes.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout Adjustments:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size and aspect ratio. This can involve:
     - Using flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
     - Scaling UI elements proportionally to fit various resolutions.
     - Adjusting the size and position of sidebars and other UI components based on the device's screen dimensions.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (keyboard/mouse for PC, touch controls for mobile).
   - **Networking:** If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play.

### 4. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **Control Schemes:** Design intuitive control schemes for mobile devices, which may differ significantly from PC controls.
   - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the game for mobile devices, which may have less processing power compared to PCs.

### 5. **Testing:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Conduct thorough testing on both platforms to ensure that the game performs well and that the user experience is consistent across devices.

### 6. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **User Interface Differences:** If the UI is significantly different between platforms, it may confuse players who switch between devices. Aim for a consistent design language while adapting to each platform's strengths.
   - **Gameplay Mechanics:** Ensure that gameplay mechanics are intuitive on both platforms. If certain features are only available on one platform, make that clear to users.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility and adjust the UI for different screen sizes, careful planning and execution are essential to minimize confusion. By maintaining a clear distinction between the PC and mobile versions while ensuring a cohesive experience, you can create a successful cross-platform game.
