Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: You can maintain a separate version for PC and mobile. This allows you to optimize each version for its platform but can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Using a single codebase that adapts to different platforms can simplify updates and maintenance. Frameworks like Unity or Unreal Engine support cross-platform development.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI based on the screen size and aspect ratio. Use flexible layouts (like anchors and relative positioning) to ensure that the sidebar and other UI elements resize appropriately.
   - **Dynamic Scaling**: Use techniques like scaling the UI elements based on the screen resolution to ensure they look good on both PC and mobile.

### 3. **Input Handling**
   - **Touch vs. Mouse**: Implement different input handling for touch screens and mouse/keyboard. This may involve creating touch-friendly controls for mobile while keeping the traditional controls for PC.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Mobile devices typically have less processing power than PCs. Optimize graphics and performance for mobile without compromising the PC experience.

### 5. **Testing Across Platforms**
   - Thoroughly test the game on various devices to ensure that the experience is consistent and enjoyable across platforms. Pay attention to UI scaling, performance, and input responsiveness.

### 6. **User Experience Considerations**
   - **Consistency**: Ensure that the core gameplay experience remains consistent across platforms. Players should feel familiar with the game regardless of the device they are using.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding**: Consider how you will introduce new controls and features to users on different platforms.

### 7. **Potential Confusion**
   - **User Interface Differences**: If the UI is significantly different between platforms, it may confuse players who switch between devices. Aim for a consistent design language.
   - **Control Schemes**: Different control schemes can lead to confusion. Clearly communicate the controls for each platform, possibly through in-game tutorials or settings menus.

### Conclusion
While it is entirely feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add cross-platform compatibility, careful planning and execution are essential to minimize confusion and ensure a smooth user experience. By focusing on responsive design, consistent gameplay, and thorough testing, you can create a game that works well across both PC and mobile platforms.
