Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: You can maintain the PC version and create a separate mobile version. This allows for tailored optimizations for each platform but can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Using a single codebase that adapts to different platforms can simplify updates and maintenance. Frameworks like Unity or Unreal Engine support cross-platform development.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Resolution**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI based on the screen size and aspect ratio. Use relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed units (like pixels) for UI elements.
   - **Dynamic Layouts**: Use layout managers or responsive design techniques to rearrange UI elements based on the screen size. This can include hiding, resizing, or repositioning elements.

### 3. **Input Handling**
   - **Touch vs. Mouse**: Ensure that the game can handle both touch inputs for mobile devices and mouse/keyboard inputs for PC. This may involve creating different control schemes or input mappings.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Mobile devices typically have less processing power than PCs, so optimize graphics, reduce asset sizes, and manage memory usage to ensure smooth performance on both platforms.

### 5. **Testing Across Devices**
   - Thoroughly test the game on various devices to ensure that the experience is consistent and enjoyable across platforms. This includes checking for UI scaling, performance, and input responsiveness.

### 6. **User Experience Considerations**
   - **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent user experience across platforms, but be mindful of platform-specific conventions (e.g., navigation patterns).
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding**: Provide clear tutorials or onboarding experiences that cater to both PC and mobile users, as they may have different expectations.

### 7. **Version Control**
   - If you want to keep the PC version unchanged, consider using version control systems (like Git) to manage changes and ensure that updates for mobile do not affect the PC version.

### Confusion and Challenges
- **User Confusion**: If the game experience differs significantly between platforms, users may feel confused. Aim for a balance between maintaining the core experience and adapting to platform-specific needs.
- **Development Complexity**: Managing a cross-platform game can increase complexity, especially if you need to handle different input methods, screen sizes, and performance optimizations.
- **Testing Overhead**: More platforms mean more testing, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

### Conclusion
While it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility while keeping the PC version unchanged, it requires careful planning and execution. By focusing on responsive design, input handling, and thorough testing, you can create a cohesive experience across devices. However, be prepared for the challenges that come with managing a cross-platform game.
