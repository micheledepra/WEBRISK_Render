Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version:** Develop a separate build for mobile devices that can run alongside the PC version.

### 2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Shared Codebase:** Use a game engine that supports cross-platform development (like Unity or Unreal Engine) to share as much code as possible between the PC and mobile versions.
   - **Input Handling:** Implement touch controls for mobile while retaining keyboard/mouse controls for PC.

### 3. **Aspect Ratio and UI Adjustments:**
   - **Responsive Design:** Design the user interface (UI) to be responsive, meaning it can adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios. This may involve using layout tools provided by the game engine.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling:** Implement logic to adjust the size and position of UI elements (like sidebars) based on the screen dimensions. This can help ensure a consistent experience across devices.

### 4. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Test the game on various devices to ensure that the gameplay experience is smooth and that the UI is functional and visually appealing.
   - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the game for mobile devices, which may have different performance capabilities compared to PCs.

### 5. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **Consistent Experience:** Aim for a consistent experience across platforms, but be aware that some features may need to be adjusted or omitted on mobile due to hardware limitations.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding:** Provide clear tutorials or onboarding processes for mobile users, as they may be unfamiliar with the controls or gameplay mechanics.

### 6. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **User Interface Differences:** If the UI is significantly different between platforms, it may confuse players who switch between devices. Aim for a similar look and feel.
   - **Gameplay Mechanics:** Ensure that gameplay mechanics are intuitive on both platforms. If certain features are only available on one platform, communicate this clearly to users.
   - **Cross-Platform Play:** If you plan to allow cross-platform play, ensure that matchmaking and player interactions are seamless.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are crucial to minimize confusion and ensure a smooth user experience across platforms. By focusing on responsive design, shared codebases, and thorough testing, you can create a cohesive experience for players on both PC and mobile devices.
