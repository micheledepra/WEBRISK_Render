Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Build:** Develop a separate version of the game optimized for mobile devices. This may involve adjusting controls, UI, and performance settings.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Resolution:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the game's aspect ratio and UI elements based on the screen size. Use relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed units (like pixels) for layout elements.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling:** Create a UI that scales appropriately for different screen sizes. This may involve using layout managers or frameworks that support responsive design.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (touch for mobile, keyboard/mouse for PC). This may require implementing different control schemes.
   - **Networking:** If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play.

### 4. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **Consistent Experience:** Aim for a consistent experience across platforms, but be mindful of the differences in interaction (e.g., touch vs. mouse).
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding:** Provide tutorials or onboarding experiences that cater to the specific platform to reduce confusion for new players.

### 5. **Testing and Feedback:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Test the game on various devices to ensure that the UI and gameplay are functioning as intended across different screen sizes and resolutions.
   - **Gather Feedback:** Collect feedback from users on both platforms to identify any areas of confusion or difficulty.

### Potential Confusion:
- **User Interface Differences:** If the UI is significantly different between platforms, users may find it confusing. Aim for a balance between platform-specific optimizations and a unified design language.
- **Control Schemes:** Switching between control schemes (e.g., from touch to mouse) can be disorienting if not handled well. Clear communication about controls is essential.
- **Performance Variability:** Mobile devices may have different performance characteristics compared to PCs, which could lead to variations in gameplay experience.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility while keeping the PC version unchanged, careful planning and execution are crucial to minimize confusion. By focusing on responsive design, consistent user experience, and thorough testing, you can create a game that works well across both PC and mobile platforms.
