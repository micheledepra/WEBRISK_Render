Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: You can maintain a separate version for PC and mobile. This allows you to optimize each version for its platform but can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Using a single codebase that adapts to different platforms can simplify updates and maintenance. Frameworks like Unity or Unreal Engine support cross-platform development.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size. Use relative positioning and scaling to ensure that the game looks good on both PC and mobile.
   - **Dynamic UI**: Create a UI that can rearrange itself based on the available screen space. This may involve using flexible layouts or grids that can adapt to different resolutions.

### 3. **Input Handling**
   - **Touch vs. Mouse**: Implement different input handling for touch screens and mouse/keyboard. This may involve creating touch-friendly controls for mobile while keeping the traditional controls for PC.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Resource Management**: Ensure that the game runs smoothly on both platforms by optimizing graphics and performance. Mobile devices typically have less processing power than PCs, so you may need to adjust graphics settings accordingly.

### 5. **Testing Across Devices**
   - **Cross-Platform Testing**: Regularly test the game on various devices to ensure compatibility and performance. This will help identify any issues that arise from different screen sizes and input methods.

### 6. **User Experience Considerations**
   - **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent user experience across platforms. While the controls and layout may differ, the core gameplay and aesthetics should remain similar.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding**: Provide tutorials or onboarding experiences that cater to the specific controls and interfaces of each platform.

### 7. **Potential Confusion**
   - **User Confusion**: If not implemented carefully, users may find it confusing if the game behaves differently on different platforms. Clear communication about controls and features is essential.
   - **Feature Parity**: Ensure that key features are available on both platforms to avoid frustration. If certain features are exclusive to one platform, make this clear to users.

### Conclusion
While adding cross-platform compatibility and adjusting for different screen sizes can introduce complexity, it is manageable with careful planning and execution. The key is to maintain a balance between optimizing for each platform and providing a consistent experience for users. By following best practices in responsive design, input handling, and performance optimization, you can create a game that works well on both PC and mobile devices without causing significant confusion for players.
