Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. This approach typically involves several key steps:

1. **Separate Builds**: Maintain separate builds for PC and mobile. This allows you to keep the PC version as it is while developing a mobile version that can accommodate different screen sizes and input methods.

2. **Responsive Design**: Implement a responsive design for the mobile version. This includes adjusting the aspect ratio and dimensions of UI elements (like sidebars) based on the screen size. You can use flexible layouts, scaling, and anchoring techniques to ensure that the game looks good on various devices.

3. **Input Adaptation**: Adapt the controls for mobile devices. Touch controls will differ significantly from keyboard and mouse inputs, so you'll need to design a user interface that is intuitive for touch interactions.

4. **Testing Across Devices**: Thoroughly test the game on various devices to ensure that the gameplay experience is consistent and enjoyable. This includes checking for performance issues, graphical fidelity, and usability.

5. **Cross-Platform Play**: If you want players on different platforms to play together, you'll need to implement cross-platform networking. This can be complex, as it involves ensuring that game mechanics and performance are balanced across platforms.

### Potential Confusion

1. **User Experience**: Players may find it confusing if the game experience differs significantly between platforms. It's essential to maintain a consistent core gameplay experience while adapting the UI and controls.

2. **Updates and Features**: If you introduce new features or updates, you need to ensure that they are implemented across both platforms in a way that makes sense for each. This can lead to confusion if players on one platform have access to features that are not available on another.

3. **Performance Variability**: Mobile devices may have different performance capabilities compared to PCs. Ensuring that the game runs smoothly on all devices without compromising the experience can be challenging.

4. **Communication**: Clear communication with your player base is crucial. Make sure to inform players about any differences in gameplay, controls, or features between the PC and mobile versions.

### Conclusion

While it is feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are necessary to minimize confusion and ensure a seamless experience across platforms. By focusing on responsive design, input adaptation, and thorough testing, you can create a game that is enjoyable for players on both PC and mobile devices.
