Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds**:
   - **Maintain Separate Codebases**: You can maintain a separate codebase for the mobile version while keeping the PC version intact. This allows you to implement mobile-specific features without affecting the PC version.
   - **Shared Assets**: Use shared assets (like graphics and sounds) to minimize duplication and ensure consistency across platforms.

### 2. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the aspect ratio and layout based on the screen size. This can involve using flexible UI elements that scale or reposition based on the device's resolution.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling**: Use techniques like anchoring and scaling to ensure that UI elements (like sidebars) adjust properly on different screen sizes.

### 3. **Input Handling**:
   - **Touch vs. Mouse Input**: Implement different input handling for touch screens (mobile) and mouse/keyboard (PC). This may involve creating touch-friendly controls for mobile while keeping traditional controls for PC.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - **Networking**: If your game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play. This may involve using a common server architecture that can handle connections from both PC and mobile clients.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Optimize performance for mobile devices, which may have less processing power compared to PCs. This could involve reducing graphical fidelity or simplifying certain game mechanics.

### 5. **User Experience**:
   - **Consistent Experience**: Aim for a consistent user experience across platforms, but be mindful of the differences in interaction methods and screen sizes. This may require some design compromises.
   - **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing on both platforms to ensure that the game is enjoyable and functional on each device.

### 6. **Potential Confusion**:
   - **User Interface Differences**: If the UI is significantly different between platforms, it may confuse players who switch between devices. Strive for a balance between platform-specific design and a unified experience.
   - **Feature Discrepancies**: If certain features are available on one platform but not the other, it could lead to confusion. Clearly communicate any differences to players.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility while keeping the PC version unchanged, careful planning and execution are essential to minimize confusion and ensure a smooth user experience. By focusing on responsive design, consistent user experience, and thorough testing, you can create a game that works well across both PC and mobile platforms.
