Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version:** Develop a separate build for mobile platforms (iOS and Android) that includes the necessary adjustments for touch controls and screen sizes.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout Adjustments:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size and aspect ratio. This can involve:
     - Using flexible layouts (e.g., relative positioning, anchors).
     - Scaling UI elements proportionally.
     - Hiding or rearranging elements that may not fit well on smaller screens.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (mouse/keyboard for PC, touch controls for mobile).
   - **Networking:** If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play.

### 4. **Testing Across Devices:**
   - **Device Testing:** Test the game on various devices to ensure that the gameplay experience is consistent and enjoyable across platforms.
   - **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from users on both platforms to identify any issues or areas for improvement.

### 5. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **User Experience:** If the game mechanics or UI differ significantly between platforms, it could lead to confusion among players. To mitigate this:
     - Maintain consistent gameplay mechanics across platforms.
     - Use clear visual cues and tutorials to guide users on how to interact with the game on different devices.
   - **Communication:** Clearly communicate any differences in gameplay or controls to users, possibly through in-game tutorials or documentation.

### 6. **Considerations for Development:**
   - **Resource Allocation:** Ensure that you have the necessary resources (time, budget, and personnel) to develop and maintain both versions of the game.
   - **Frameworks and Tools:** Consider using game development frameworks that support cross-platform development (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine) to streamline the process.

### Conclusion:
While adding cross-platform compatibility and adjusting the UI for different screen sizes can be complex, it is certainly achievable with careful planning and execution. The key is to maintain a consistent user experience while adapting to the unique requirements of each platform.
