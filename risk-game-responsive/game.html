Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: You can maintain a separate version of the game for PC and mobile. This allows you to optimize each version for its respective platform but can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Using a single codebase that adapts to different platforms can simplify updates and maintenance. Frameworks like Unity or Unreal Engine support cross-platform development.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Resolution**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the game's UI and gameplay elements based on the screen size and aspect ratio. This can involve using anchors and layout groups in UI frameworks.
   - **Dynamic Scaling**: Use techniques to scale graphics and UI elements dynamically. This ensures that the game looks good on both large PC monitors and smaller mobile screens.

### 3. **User Interface Adjustments**
   - **Sidebar and HUD**: Adjust the dimensions and layout of the sidebar and HUD elements based on the screen size. For mobile, consider using collapsible menus or touch-friendly buttons.
   - **Touch Controls**: Implement touch controls for mobile devices, which may differ significantly from keyboard and mouse controls on PC.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - **Input Handling**: Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (keyboard/mouse for PC, touch for mobile). This may require creating an abstraction layer for input handling.
   - **Networking**: If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play.

### 5. **Testing and Optimization**
   - **Extensive Testing**: Test the game on various devices to ensure that the experience is consistent and enjoyable across platforms. Pay attention to performance, as mobile devices may have different hardware capabilities.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Optimize assets and code to ensure smooth performance on both PC and mobile. This may involve reducing texture sizes, optimizing scripts, and managing memory usage.

### 6. **User Experience Considerations**
   - **Consistency**: Aim for a consistent user experience across platforms, but be mindful of the differences in interaction paradigms (e.g., touch vs. mouse).
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding**: Provide tutorials or onboarding experiences that cater to the specific controls and gameplay mechanics of each platform.

### Confusion and Complexity
- **Potential Confusion**: Maintaining a cross-platform game can introduce complexity, especially if the gameplay experience differs significantly between platforms. Players may become confused if features are available on one platform but not another.
- **Development Complexity**: The development process may become more complex, requiring additional resources for testing and optimization. Clear documentation and communication within the development team are essential to manage this complexity.

### Conclusion
While it is entirely feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, it requires careful planning and execution. By focusing on responsive design, user interface adjustments, and thorough testing, you can create a cohesive experience across platforms while minimizing confusion for players.
