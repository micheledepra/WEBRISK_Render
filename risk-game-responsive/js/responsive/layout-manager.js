Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version:** Develop a separate build for mobile platforms (iOS and Android) that can share some assets and code with the PC version but is optimized for touch controls and smaller screens.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout Adjustments:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size. This includes:
     - **Dynamic Aspect Ratios:** Use flexible layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
     - **Adjustable Sidebars:** Design sidebars and other UI elements to resize or reposition based on the available screen space.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (mouse/keyboard for PC, touch controls for mobile).
   - **Shared Game Logic:** If possible, share game logic and assets between the PC and mobile versions to reduce development time and maintain consistency.

### 4. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **Consistent Gameplay:** Ensure that the gameplay experience is consistent across platforms, even if the controls and UI differ.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding:** Provide tutorials or onboarding experiences tailored to each platform to help users understand the controls and interface.

### 5. **Testing and Feedback:**
   - **Cross-Platform Testing:** Conduct thorough testing on both PC and mobile devices to identify any issues with gameplay, controls, or UI.
   - **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from users on both platforms to make necessary adjustments and improvements.

### 6. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **User Expectations:** Users may have different expectations based on the platform they are using. Clear communication about the differences in gameplay and controls is essential.
   - **UI Complexity:** If the UI becomes too complex due to the need to accommodate various screen sizes and input methods, it could lead to confusion. Strive for simplicity and clarity in design.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to maintain the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are crucial. By focusing on responsive design, consistent gameplay, and clear communication, you can minimize confusion and create a seamless experience across platforms.
