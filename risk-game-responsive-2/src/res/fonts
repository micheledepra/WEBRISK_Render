Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds**:
   - **Maintain the PC Version**: Keep the existing PC version unchanged to ensure that current users have a consistent experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version**: Develop a separate build for mobile devices that can be optimized for touch controls and smaller screens.

### 2. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Aspect Ratio and Resolution**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the game's UI and graphics based on the screen size and aspect ratio. This can involve using flexible layouts and scaling assets appropriately.
   - **Dynamic UI Elements**: Use scalable vector graphics (SVGs) or other scalable assets for UI elements that can adapt to different screen sizes.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - **Input Handling**: Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (keyboard/mouse for PC, touch controls for mobile).
   - **Networking**: If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play.

### 4. **User Experience**:
   - **UI Adjustments**: Modify the sidebar and other UI elements to fit mobile screens. This may involve hiding certain elements or providing alternative layouts.
   - **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing on various devices to ensure that the game performs well and is user-friendly across platforms.

### 5. **Potential Confusion**:
   - **User Interface Differences**: Players may find it confusing if the UI or gameplay mechanics differ significantly between platforms. Aim for consistency in core gameplay while adapting controls and layouts.
   - **Communication**: Clearly communicate any differences in gameplay or controls to users. Tutorials or onboarding processes can help ease the transition for players switching between platforms.

### 6. **Development Considerations**:
   - **Frameworks and Tools**: Use game engines or frameworks that support cross-platform development (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine) to streamline the process.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Mobile devices have different performance capabilities than PCs, so optimize graphics and processing to ensure smooth gameplay.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add cross-platform compatibility, careful planning and execution are essential to minimize confusion and ensure a seamless experience for players. By focusing on responsive design, consistent user experience, and thorough testing, you can create a successful cross-platform game.
