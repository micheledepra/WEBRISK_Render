Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version:** Develop a separate build optimized for mobile devices. This version can have different controls, UI layouts, and performance optimizations.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout Adjustments:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size. This includes:
     - **Dynamic Aspect Ratios:** Use flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations (portrait vs. landscape).
     - **Adjustable Sidebars:** Design sidebars and other UI components to resize or reposition based on the available screen space.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (touch for mobile, keyboard/mouse for PC).
   - **Networking:** If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play.

### 4. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **Consistent Experience:** Aim for a consistent experience across platforms, but be aware that some features may need to be adjusted or simplified for mobile.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding:** Provide clear tutorials for mobile users, as controls and gameplay may differ from the PC version.

### 5. **Testing and Feedback:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Conduct thorough testing on both platforms to identify any issues related to performance, controls, and UI.
   - **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from users on both platforms to refine the experience and address any confusion.

### 6. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **Learning Curve:** Users transitioning from PC to mobile may experience a learning curve due to different controls and UI layouts.
   - **Feature Discrepancies:** If certain features are available on one platform but not the other, it could lead to confusion.
   - **Performance Expectations:** Users may have different expectations regarding performance and graphics quality based on their platform.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to maintain the PC version and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are crucial to minimize confusion and ensure a smooth user experience across platforms. By focusing on responsive design, consistent gameplay, and thorough testing, you can create a successful cross-platform game.
