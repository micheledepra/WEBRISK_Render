Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds:**
   - **Maintain Separate Codebases:** You can maintain a separate codebase for the mobile version while keeping the PC version intact. This allows you to implement mobile-specific features without affecting the PC version.
   - **Shared Assets:** Use shared assets where possible to minimize duplication of resources.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the aspect ratio and layout based on the device's screen size. This can involve using flexible UI elements that scale or reposition based on the resolution.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling:** Use relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed units (like pixels) for UI elements to ensure they adapt to different screen sizes.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (touch for mobile, keyboard/mouse for PC). This may involve creating a unified input system that can detect the platform and adjust accordingly.
   - **Networking:** If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play.

### 4. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Test the game on various devices to ensure that the user experience is consistent and that the UI adapts correctly to different screen sizes.
   - **Performance Optimization:** Mobile devices may have different performance characteristics compared to PCs, so optimize the game for mobile hardware.

### 5. **User Experience:**
   - **Consistent Experience:** Aim to provide a consistent user experience across platforms. This includes maintaining similar gameplay mechanics, graphics quality, and overall feel.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding:** Consider how to onboard users on different platforms, as mobile users may need different guidance compared to PC users.

### 6. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **User Interface Differences:** If the UI is significantly different between platforms, it may confuse players who switch between them. Aim for a unified design language.
   - **Control Schemes:** Different control schemes can lead to confusion if not clearly communicated. Provide clear instructions for each platform's controls.
   - **Feature Parity:** If certain features are available on one platform but not the other, this could lead to frustration. Clearly communicate any differences to users.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility while keeping the PC version unchanged, careful planning and execution are essential to minimize confusion and ensure a smooth user experience. By focusing on responsive design, consistent user experience, and thorough testing, you can create a game that works well across both PC and mobile platforms.
