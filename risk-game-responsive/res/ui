Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds:**
   - **Maintain Separate Codebases:** You can maintain a separate codebase for mobile while keeping the PC version intact. This allows you to make changes specific to mobile without affecting the PC version.
   - **Shared Assets:** Use shared assets where possible to minimize duplication, but keep platform-specific logic separate.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the aspect ratio and layout based on the screen size. This can involve using flexible UI elements that scale or reposition based on the device's resolution.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling:** Use techniques like anchoring and scaling to ensure that UI elements (like sidebars) adjust according to the screen size. This may involve using percentage-based dimensions or relative positioning.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Ensure that the game can handle different input methods (touch for mobile, keyboard/mouse for PC). This may require creating an abstraction layer for input handling.
   - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the game for mobile devices, which may have less processing power than PCs. This could involve reducing graphical fidelity or simplifying certain game mechanics.

### 4. **User Experience:**
   - **Consistent Experience:** Aim to provide a consistent user experience across platforms. This means keeping core gameplay mechanics the same while adapting controls and UI for mobile.
   - **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing on both platforms to ensure that the game feels natural and intuitive on each device.

### 5. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **User Confusion:** If the game mechanics or UI differ significantly between platforms, players may become confused. To mitigate this, try to keep the core gameplay experience consistent.
   - **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation or tutorials for players transitioning between platforms to help them understand any differences.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility and adjust the UI for different screen sizes without changing the PC version, careful planning and execution are essential. The complexity of the implementation will depend on the existing architecture of the game and how different the mobile experience needs to be. By focusing on responsive design and maintaining a consistent user experience, you can minimize confusion for players.
