Adding cross-platform compatibility to a PC game while keeping the PC version unchanged can be a complex task, but it is certainly feasible. Here are some considerations and steps you might take to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version unchanged to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version:** Develop a separate build for mobile devices (iOS and Android) that can run alongside the PC version.

### 2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Shared Backend:** Use a shared backend for both versions to manage user accounts, game data, and multiplayer features. This allows players on different platforms to interact seamlessly.
   - **Input Handling:** Implement different input methods for mobile (touch controls) and PC (keyboard/mouse or gamepad) while ensuring that gameplay remains consistent.

### 3. **Aspect Ratio and UI Adjustments:**
   - **Responsive Design:** Design the user interface (UI) to be responsive, meaning it can adapt to different screen sizes and aspect ratios. This may involve using flexible layouts and scalable graphics.
   - **Dynamic UI Elements:** Adjust the size and position of UI elements (like sidebars) based on the screen dimensions. This can be done using relative positioning and scaling techniques.

### 4. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Test the game on various devices to ensure that the gameplay experience is consistent and enjoyable across platforms.
   - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the game for mobile devices, which may have different hardware capabilities compared to PCs.

### 5. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **Consistency in Gameplay:** Ensure that the core gameplay mechanics remain the same across platforms to avoid confusion among players.
   - **Tutorials and Guides:** Provide clear tutorials or guides for mobile users to help them understand the controls and gameplay, especially if they differ from the PC version.

### 6. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **Learning Curve:** Players transitioning from PC to mobile may experience a learning curve due to different controls and UI layouts.
   - **Feature Discrepancies:** If certain features are available on one platform but not the other, it could lead to confusion or frustration among players.
   - **Community Fragmentation:** If the game has a competitive aspect, differences in performance or controls could lead to a fragmented community.

### Conclusion:
While it is possible to maintain the PC version unchanged and add cross-platform compatibility, careful planning and execution are essential to minimize confusion and ensure a smooth experience for all players. By focusing on responsive design, shared backends, and consistent gameplay, you can create a cohesive experience across platforms.
