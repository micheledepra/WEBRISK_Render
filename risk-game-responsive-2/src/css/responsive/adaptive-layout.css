Yes, it is possible to maintain the PC version of a game while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Codebase or Unified Codebase**
   - **Separate Codebase**: You can maintain a separate version for PC and mobile. This allows you to optimize each version for its platform but can lead to increased maintenance overhead.
   - **Unified Codebase**: Using a single codebase that adapts to different platforms can simplify updates and maintenance. Frameworks like Unity or Unreal Engine support cross-platform development.

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout**: Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size and aspect ratio. Use relative positioning and scaling to ensure that the game looks good on both PC and mobile.
   - **Dynamic UI**: Create a dynamic UI that can rearrange or resize elements based on the device. This may involve using layout managers or responsive design techniques.

### 3. **Input Handling**
   - **Touch vs. Mouse**: Implement different input handling for touch screens and mouse/keyboard. This may involve creating touch-friendly controls for mobile while keeping traditional controls for PC.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - **Networking**: If your game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play. This may involve using services that facilitate cross-platform matchmaking.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Mobile devices have different performance characteristics compared to PCs. Optimize graphics and processing to ensure smooth gameplay on both platforms.

### 5. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - **Extensive Testing**: Test the game on various devices to ensure that the experience is consistent and enjoyable across platforms. Pay attention to performance, controls, and UI layout.
   - **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from users on both platforms to identify any confusion or usability issues.

### 6. **Potential Confusion**
   - **User Experience**: If not implemented carefully, users may find the experience confusing, especially if the controls or UI differ significantly between platforms. Consistency in design and functionality is key.
   - **Learning Curve**: Players transitioning from one platform to another may need to adapt to different controls or layouts, which could lead to confusion.

### Conclusion
While it is entirely feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are crucial. Focus on responsive design, input handling, and thorough testing to minimize confusion and ensure a seamless experience across platforms.
