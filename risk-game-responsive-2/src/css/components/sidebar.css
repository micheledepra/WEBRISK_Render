Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds:**
   - **Maintain Separate Codebases:** You can maintain a separate codebase for mobile while keeping the PC version intact. This allows you to implement mobile-specific features without affecting the PC version.
   - **Shared Assets:** Use shared assets where possible to minimize duplication, but keep platform-specific code separate.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the aspect ratio and layout based on the screen size. Use flexible UI elements that can scale or reposition themselves based on the device's resolution.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling:** Use percentage-based dimensions or relative units (like `vh`, `vw`, or `em`) for UI elements to ensure they adapt to different screen sizes.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Ensure that input methods are compatible across platforms. For example, touch controls for mobile and keyboard/mouse for PC.
   - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize performance for mobile devices, which may have less processing power compared to PCs.

### 4. **Testing:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Test the game on various devices to ensure that the experience is consistent and that the UI adapts correctly to different screen sizes and resolutions.
   - **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from users on both platforms to identify any usability issues.

### 5. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **User Experience:** If the game mechanics or UI differ significantly between platforms, it could confuse players. Aim for a consistent experience across platforms while accommodating the unique aspects of each.
   - **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation or tutorials for players to understand any differences in controls or gameplay between PC and mobile versions.

### 6. **Considerations for Development:**
   - **Frameworks and Tools:** Use game development frameworks that support cross-platform development (like Unity or Unreal Engine) to simplify the process.
   - **Version Control:** Implement a version control system to manage changes and updates across different platforms effectively.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are essential to avoid confusion and ensure a smooth user experience. By focusing on responsive design, consistent gameplay mechanics, and thorough testing, you can create a cohesive experience across platforms.
