Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version:** Develop a separate build for mobile devices that can be optimized for touch controls and smaller screens.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout Adjustments:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the aspect ratio and layout based on the screen size. This can involve:
     - Using flexible UI elements that scale according to the screen dimensions.
     - Adjusting the position and size of UI components (like sidebars) to fit different screen sizes.
     - Ensuring that the game maintains its visual integrity across devices.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Shared Codebase:** If possible, use a shared codebase for both PC and mobile versions to streamline development and maintenance.
   - **Input Handling:** Implement different input methods (keyboard/mouse for PC, touch controls for mobile) while keeping the core gameplay mechanics consistent.

### 4. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **Consistency in Gameplay:** Ensure that the gameplay experience remains consistent across platforms, even if the controls and UI differ.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding:** Provide tutorials or onboarding experiences tailored to each platform to help users understand the controls and interface.

### 5. **Testing and Feedback:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Conduct thorough testing on both platforms to identify any issues related to performance, controls, or UI.
   - **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from users on both platforms to make necessary adjustments and improvements.

### 6. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **Learning Curve:** Users transitioning from PC to mobile may experience a learning curve due to different controls and UI layouts.
   - **Feature Discrepancies:** If certain features are available on one platform but not the other, it could lead to confusion. Clear communication about what to expect on each platform is essential.
   - **Performance Variability:** Users may notice differences in performance or graphics quality between the two versions, which could lead to confusion regarding the game's capabilities.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility and adjust the UI for different screen sizes, careful planning and execution are crucial to minimize confusion. By maintaining a consistent gameplay experience and providing clear communication, you can create a seamless experience for users across both PC and mobile platforms.
