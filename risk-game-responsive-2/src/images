Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds for PC and Mobile:**
   - **Maintain the PC Version:** Keep the existing PC version intact to avoid disrupting the current user experience.
   - **Create a Mobile Version:** Develop a separate build for mobile devices that can share some assets and code with the PC version but is optimized for touch controls and smaller screens.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout Adjustments:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the UI elements based on the screen size. This includes:
     - **Dynamic UI Scaling:** Use relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed pixel values for UI elements.
     - **Aspect Ratio Handling:** Ensure that the game can adapt to different aspect ratios by using anchors or flexible layouts.
     - **Sidebar Adjustments:** Modify the sidebar dimensions and positioning based on the screen size, ensuring that it remains functional and visually appealing on both PC and mobile.

### 3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Input Handling:** Implement touch controls for mobile while retaining keyboard and mouse support for PC. Consider using a unified input system that can detect the platform and adjust accordingly.
   - **Networking:** If the game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play, allowing PC and mobile users to interact seamlessly.

### 4. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent user experience across platforms. This includes keeping the core gameplay mechanics the same while adjusting the UI and controls.
   - **Tutorials and Onboarding:** Provide tutorials or onboarding experiences tailored to each platform to help users understand the controls and interface.

### 5. **Testing and Feedback:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Conduct thorough testing on both platforms to identify any issues related to performance, controls, and UI.
   - **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from users on both platforms to make necessary adjustments and improvements.

### Potential Confusion:
- **User Expectations:** Players may have different expectations based on the platform they are using. Clear communication about the differences in controls and UI is essential.
- **Performance Variability:** Mobile devices may have different performance capabilities compared to PCs, which could lead to confusion if not properly managed.
- **Updates and Maintenance:** Keeping two versions updated can lead to confusion if changes are made to one version but not the other. A clear versioning system and communication strategy will help mitigate this.

In summary, while it is feasible to add cross-platform compatibility while keeping the PC version unchanged, careful planning and execution are necessary to ensure a smooth user experience across different devices.
