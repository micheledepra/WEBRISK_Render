Yes, it is possible to keep the PC version of a game unchanged while adding cross-platform compatibility for mobile devices. Here are some key considerations and steps to achieve this:

### 1. **Separate Builds:**
   - **Maintain Separate Codebases:** You can maintain a separate codebase for the mobile version while keeping the PC version intact. This allows you to implement mobile-specific features without affecting the PC version.
   - **Shared Assets:** Use shared assets where possible to minimize duplication, but ensure that platform-specific adjustments are made where necessary.

### 2. **Responsive Design:**
   - **Aspect Ratio and Layout:** Implement a responsive design that adjusts the aspect ratio and layout based on the screen size. Use flexible UI elements that can scale or reposition themselves according to the device's resolution.
   - **Dynamic UI Scaling:** Use techniques like anchoring and scaling to ensure that UI elements (like sidebars) adjust properly on different screen sizes.

### 3. **Input Handling:**
   - **Touch vs. Mouse Input:** Implement different input handling for touch screens (mobile) and mouse/keyboard (PC). This may involve creating touch-friendly controls for mobile while keeping traditional controls for PC.
   - **Customizable Controls:** Allow players to customize controls based on their preferences, which can help bridge the gap between different platforms.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
   - **Networking:** If your game has multiplayer features, ensure that the networking code supports cross-platform play. This may involve using a common server architecture that can handle connections from both PC and mobile clients.
   - **Account Linking:** Consider implementing account linking or cloud saves to allow players to switch between platforms seamlessly.

### 5. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - **Extensive Testing:** Test the game on various devices to ensure that the experience is consistent and enjoyable across platforms. Pay attention to performance optimization, especially for mobile devices.
   - **User Experience:** Gather feedback from users on both platforms to identify any confusion or usability issues that may arise from the differences in controls and UI.

### 6. **Potential Confusion:**
   - **User Experience Differences:** Players may experience confusion if the gameplay or controls differ significantly between platforms. Clear communication about the differences and tutorials can help mitigate this.
   - **UI Complexity:** If the UI is too complex or cluttered on smaller screens, it may lead to frustration. Simplifying the UI for mobile users can enhance the experience.

### Conclusion:
While it is feasible to keep the PC version unchanged and add mobile compatibility, careful planning and execution are essential to ensure a smooth user experience across platforms. By focusing on responsive design, input handling, and thorough testing, you can minimize confusion and create a cohesive experience for all players.
